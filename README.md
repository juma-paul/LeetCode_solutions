# LeetCode Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository. Here, I share my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in Python. While I use Python, you can adapt the logic and implement the solutions in any programming language you are comfortable with.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific LeetCode problem. Each directory contains:

- **Python Solution File**: The Python file containing the solution to the specified problem.
- **NOTES.md**: A markdown file where I explain the steps and thought process behind solving the problem.
- **README.md**: A markdown file with LeetCode's original problem description. Each problem, e.g., [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/), is a link that redirects to LeetCode.

## Contributions

If you have a better solution or different approach to solving any problem, feel free to contribute your ideas and solutions. Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

## Setup

To run these solutions on your local machine, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **Text Editor**: Use any text editor of your choice to view and edit the code.

## Disclaimer

For the purpose of learning, I advise you to attempt solving the problems on LeetCode first before referring to these solutions. This will help you enhance your problem-solving skills.
