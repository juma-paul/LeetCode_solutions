# LeetCode Solutions

## Introduction

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository. Here, I share my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in Python. While I use Python, you can adapt the logic and implement the solutions in any programming language you are comfortable with.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific LeetCode problem. Each directory contains:

- **Python Solution File**: The Python file containing the solution to the specified problem.
- **NOTES.md**: A markdown file where I explain the steps and thought process behind solving the problem.
- **README.md**: A markdown file with LeetCode's original problem description. Each problem, e.g., [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/), is a link that redirects to LeetCode.

## Contributions

If you have a better solution or different approach to solving any problem, feel free to contribute your ideas and solutions. Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

## Setup

To run these solutions on your local machine, ensure you have the following:

- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
- **Text Editor**: Use any text editor of your choice to view and edit the code.

## Disclaimer

The solutions provided in this repository are intended for educational purposes. It is strongly advised that you attempt to solve the problems on LeetCode on your own first before referring to these solutions. This approach will help you enhance your problem-solving skills and deepen your understanding. The solutions here are not guaranteed to be the most optimal or the only correct approach.
